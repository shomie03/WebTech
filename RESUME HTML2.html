	<h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
		<p>A college student of the University of the Cordilleras, taking up Bachelor of Science and Information Technology, major in Web Technology. I was born in Lepanto Mankayan, Benguet and was raised in Mountain Province. My hobby is playing instrument like guitar, but I also play gong for cultural purposes. I make videos and edit them just for fun and also take pictures of every scenery for my blog.</p>
